note top of List 
An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). 
The user of this interface has precise control 
over where in the list each element is inserted.
end note

note left of AbstractList
This class provides a skeletal implementation of the List interface 
to minimize the effort required to implement this interface backed by 
a "random access" data store (such as an array).
end note


note right of ArrayList : Resizable-array implementation \n of the List interface
note bottom of Serializable : Serializability of a class is enabled \n by the class implementing this
