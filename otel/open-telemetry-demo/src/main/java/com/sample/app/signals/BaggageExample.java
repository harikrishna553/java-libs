/**
 * A simple example that demonstrates how to use <b>Baggage</b> in
 * OpenTelemetry.
 *
 * <p>
 * Baggage is a set of key-value pairs that are <i>propagated across service
 * boundaries</i>. Unlike attributes (which are tied to spans), baggage is
 * designed for passing <i>application-level metadata</i> such as user IDs,
 * regions, or tenant information across different services or processes in a
 * distributed system.
 *
 * <h2>How it works</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link Baggage} object is created using a builder and populated with
 * key-value pairs.</li>
 * <li>The baggage is stored in the current {@link Context} using
 * {@link Baggage#storeInContext(Context)}.</li>
 * <li>The context (with baggage attached) is passed to another function to
 * simulate cross-service propagation.</li>
 * <li>Inside the receiving function, baggage is retrieved from the context and
 * read as a {@code Map}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Why use baggage?</h2>
 * <p>
 * Baggage can be useful when you want certain metadata (for example,
 * <code>user.id</code> or <code>region</code>) to travel with every request,
 * ensuring that downstream services have access to the same information without
 * needing to explicitly include it in every API call.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Use baggage carefullyâ€”because it propagates with every request,
 * excessive baggage entries can increase request size and impact performance.
 * </p>
